IFT_Forks_Classifier
====================

This program is written to extract information from the IFT Forks database in a way that can be read by Weka.

Irwin's currently working on this with Chris Scaffidi's help.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python 2.7

* Python's SQLite connector (which I think comes installed by default)

* The ift_forks.sqlite DB from nome.eecs.oregonstate.edu:/nfs/guille/burnett/iftdata/chi2014/analysis/IFT_Forks_DB.git
